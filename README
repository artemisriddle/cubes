Protip: There's a menu that has all of the keyboard functionality (I forgot to demo it)

Base:
  4 beautiful, rotating cubes of unpredictable color. It's enough to make a grown man cry.
  Clicking changes the axis of rotation. 'Q' exits the program (useless feature).

Extra:
  keyboard command: functionality
  c: Change cube color
  x: add X axis rotation
  y: add Y axis rotation
  z: add Z axis rotation
  r: reset rotation
  >: increase speed of rotation
  <: decrease speed of rotation
  s: stop rotation
  w: wire-frame mode
  m: enable movement:
    arrow keys: move about the screen (view bobbing!)
